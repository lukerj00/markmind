# MarkMind
MarkMind is an EdTech application developed to help save teachers time when marking. By leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) tuned for this process, our app provides valuable feedback to teachers on student assignments to streamline the marking process and reduce workloads, allowing teachers to spend more time where it matters. This application is in early development, using a Django backend and Flutter frontend. This repo contains a public version of our code, for our collaborators and partners.
