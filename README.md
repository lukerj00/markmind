# MarkMind
MarkMind is an EdTech application developed to help save teachers time when marking. By leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) tuned for this process, our application provides valuable feedback to teachers on student assignments, allowing them to spend more time where it matters - interacting with students. This application is in early development, using a Django backend and Flutter frontend. This repo contains a public version of our code, for our collaborators and partners.
